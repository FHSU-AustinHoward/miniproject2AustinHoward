# Mini Project 2

## Description
This project will be using the Pandas and Matplotlib packages  in order to create interesting 
graphs with external dataframes. While not intending to be a data science project, I probably 
took it a little too far and went down the rabbit hole while learning the ropes.

The dataset I used focuses on basic specifications of sports cars, metrics such as horsepower,
price, and 0-60 times are used frequently in order to answer questions made up for the
assignment.

I sought to answer the following questions with my dataset:
* What are some cheap cars that provide the most horsepower per dollar?
* How much does the cost of a car have an impact on performance?
* Which cars utilize engines with the most horsepower per liter?
* Over the years, are cars getting faster?

## Getting Started
You will need to download [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rkiattisak/sports-car-prices-dataset)
'Sports Car Prices Dataset' from Kaggle.com in order to use the same dataframes as this project

### Pip install instructions
In a terminal window, please type the following:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Executing program
In a terminal window, please type the following:
```
