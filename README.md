# Mini Project 2
## Description

This project will be using Pandas and Faker to create dataframes. This isn't intended to be full blown data science 
project. The goal here is to come up with some question and then see what API or datasets you can use to get the

researching APIs and gathering datasets. If you get stuck here, please email me!
